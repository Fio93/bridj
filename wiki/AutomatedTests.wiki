== Running Cobertura ==

It's easy to create a test coverage report by yourself if you [Build build BridJ from sources] :
{{{
mvn cobertura:cobertura site
}}}
The coverage report is then in `target/site/cobertura`.

== Last published Cobertura reports ==

Every once in a while, we publish test coverage reports of the development version of BridJ.
If you want up-to-date reports, you should rather build BridJ from sources and look at the preceding section.
