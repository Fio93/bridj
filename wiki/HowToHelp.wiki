#summary How to help with the development of BridJ

= Introduction =

BridJ is an ambitious project that aims at becoming the ultimate free interop library for Java (free as in freedom and beer : BSD).

While currently developed by a single individual, BridJ and JNAerator have already received many contributions in the form of source code, bug reports and suggestions.

Even if you're not a programmer you're welcome to contribute to these projects, and we'll be happy to help you with your contribution.

This page details some ways you can help us.
