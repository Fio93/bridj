= Introduction =

BridJ is an ambitious project that aims at becoming the ultimate free interop library for Java (free as in freedom and beer : BSD).

While currently [mailto:olivier.chafik@gmail.com developed by a single individual], BridJ and JNAerator have already received [CreditsAndLicense many contributions] in the form of source code, bug reports and suggestions.

Even if you're not a programmer you're welcome to contribute to these projects, and we'll be happy to help you with your contribution.

This page details some ways you can help us.

If any item rings a bell, 
[http://groups.google.fr/group/nativelibs4java let's discuss it].

= New projects = 

See [GoogleSummerOfCode] for details on some ambitious sub-project that will likely no see the light of day without your help.

= Bug Fixes and Enhancements = 

There are [Issues Many], just waiting for you.

= Graphics =

BridJ has no icon, JNAerator either.

Feel like changing that ?

= Money or Hardware donations = 

BridJ is developped, debugged and built on different CPU architectures and different operating systems (Windows 32/64, Linux x86/x64, MacOS x86/x64/ppc).

What refrains me from porting it to Solaris (sparcv8, sparcv9) or FreeBSD is I don't have the appropriate hardware and / or system administration knowledge. If you do, please help by sending me hardware and / or advice.

In the case of hardware lending, I can guarantee return of the hardware if we negociate the associated costs.
