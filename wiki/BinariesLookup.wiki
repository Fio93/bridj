#summary Details on how BridJ looks up binary files

= External binaries =

== Lookup paths ==

BridJ needs to know where to find binaries. 

Depending on the platform, the following environment variables are used as lookup paths :
  * `PATH`
  * `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  * `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`

The following Java properties are also used :
  * `java.library.path`
  * `gnu.classpath.boot.library.path`

The following paths are also used :
  * `.`
  * `${java.home}/bin`
  * `${java.home}/../Libraries` on MacOS X

== Explicit paths ==

For a given library with name `Xxx`, BridJ uses the environment variable BRIDJ_XXX_LIBRARY or the property `bridj.Xxx.library` for explicit full path of the library binary file.
