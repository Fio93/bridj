[http://jnaerator.sourceforge.net/webstart/JNAerator/JNAeratorStudio.jnlp You can try BridJ quickly] through [http://jnaerator.googlecode.com/ JNAerator] (just select "BridJ" in the "Runtime" combobox).

= Get BridJ =

It is advised to use Maven or sbt to manage dependencies automatically.

== Direct downloads ==

  * Download JARs : [http://code.google.com/p/bridj/downloads/list Downloads Section]
  * [http://nativelibs4java.sourceforge.net/maven/com/nativelibs4java/bridj/ Binary snapshots]

== Use with Maven ==

{{{
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>nativelibs4java-repo</id>
    <url>http://nativelibs4java.sourceforge.net/maven</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
	<groupId>com.nativelibs4java</groupId>
	<artifactId>bridj</artifactId>
	<version>0.4.2</version>
	<!--
	<classifier>c-only</classifier>
	-->
	<scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
}}}

== Use with sbt ==

{{{
import sbt._

class Project(info: ProjectInfo) extends DefaultProject(info)
{
  val nativelibs4javaRepo = "NativeLibs4Java Repository" at "http://nativelibs4java.sourceforge.net/maven/"
  val bridj = "com.nativelibs4java" % "bridj" % "0.4.2"
}
}}}

== Smaller specialized versions (Maven classifiers) ==

Optionally : choose a classifier (JAR filename suffix) that corresponds to a smaller trimmed-down of BridJ, if you're afraid BridJ is too heavy for you :

|| Classifier || C || C++ || Objective-C || COM || .NET || Windows (x86, x64) || MacOS X (universal) || iOS (arm) || Linux (x86, x64) || Solaris (x86) || Android (arm) ||
|| _empty_ || x || x || x || x || x || x || x || x || x || x ||  ||
|| `c-only` || x ||  ||  ||  ||  || x || x || x || x || x ||  ||
|| `windows-only` || x || x ||  || x || x || x ||  ||  ||  || ||  ||
|| `unix-only` || x || x || x ||  ||  ||  || x || x || x || x ||  ||
|| `linux-only` || x || x ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || x ||  ||  ||
|| `macosx-only` || x || x || x ||  ||  ||  || x ||  ||  ||  ||  ||
|| `android` || x || x ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || x ||

Note that you can use the [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/ Maven Shade Plugin] in your own project to strip away native libraries (in the `org/bridj/lib/*` packages) and classes (such as COM support in `org/bridj/cpp/com/*`) that you don't need. Take [http://code.google.com/p/nativelibs4java/source/browse/trunk/libraries/Runtime/BridJ/pom.xml BridJ's pom] as example.

= Platform notes =

== Windows ==

C, C++, COM support is ok.

.NET support is non-existent.

== Linux ==

C, C++ support is ok.

== Solaris ==

Only Solaris x86 is supported (test hardware would be welcome !).

C, C++ support is ok, with some issues in endianness-aware reading/writing with Pointer.

== MacOS X ==

C, C++ support is ok.

Objective-C support is dramatically undertested and probably very poor. Help would be appreciated...

== Android ==

[http://code.google.com/p/nativelibs4java/issues/detail?id=69 BridJ support for Android is on its way] with some reports of success.

== iOS (jailbroken iPhones and iPads) ==

BridJ's support for iOS is not working properly yet, and relies on [http://jamvm.sourceforge.net/ JamVM].
