#summary How to use pointers in BridJ
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Anatomy of a pointer =

In BridJ, each pointer exposes the following data :
  * a peer, which is the long value of the memory address it points to.
  * a target type, which is null for `Pointer<?>` instances.
  * a byte order (as NIO buffers), which states whether data will be read from this pointer in big endian or little endian mode

= Typed pointers =

A typed pointer is a subclass of the `Pointer<?>` class that corresponds in C to some void pointer or opaque pointer typedef :
{{{
typedef void* HWND;
typedef struct _S* S;
}}}
