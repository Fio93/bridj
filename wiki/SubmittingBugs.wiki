#summary How to submit bug reports for BridJ

If you submit an [Issues issue], please make sure to provide all of the following items to maximize the chances we can help you quickly :
  * Working code : any of the following :
    * a class with a static main method that compiles directly against BridJ's JAR
    * a JUnit test class that can just be dropped into [https://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java/tree/master/libraries/Runtime/BridJ/src/test/java/org/bridj BridJ's test sources]
    * an archive of a project that compiles *easily* with Maven or Ant
  _In particular, please make sure to include the source code of your BridJ bindings to the report._
  * Instructions on how to run your code :
    * full command-line
    * prequisites : 
      * native library to install manually ? 
      * specific hardware ?
      * other dependencies (direct links, please !)
  * The full error log of BridJ :
    * Set the `BRIDJ_VERY_VERBOSE=1` environment variable prior to running your program / test class
    * Include the `hs_err_pidXXX.log` core dump files to the report
    * In case the program never ends (hangs with no normal reason), run `jconsole` and include a dump of the execution trace of the main thread (or of all of them) to the report
  * A direct link to the native library targeted by your bindings, if possible and if needed to reproduce the issue
  * The full C/C++/Objective-C headers of the native library
  * The exact [http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/ JNAerator] arguments you've used to generate your bindings, if you've used that tool (which is highly advised !)
