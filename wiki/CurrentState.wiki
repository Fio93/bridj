#summary Current State of the BridJ project

= Tested Platforms =

Binaries are currently available and routinely tested for the following platforms :
  * Windows (32 & 64 bits)
  * MacOS X (Universal : PPC, Intel 32 & 64 bits)
  * Linux (32 bits)

= Working Features =

  * JNAerator support
  * C functions calls with __cdecl and __stdcall conventions
  * C++ method calls
  * Define C callbacks out of Java instances + calling native C callbacks from Java
  * typed opaque pointers
  * feature-full Pointer class (reified generic)
  * Type-safe enums (ValuedEnum + FlagSet classes)
  * COM object creation and calls (tested on Win 64 bits only)
  * lightweight structs

= Features in progress = 

  * C++ classes fields
  * C++ subclassing (virtual __thiscall and __fastcall callbacks, vtable synthetization)
  * C++ templates (functions and 
  * generic callback types (`Func0<R>`, `Func1<R, A1>`...)
  * varargs
  * assembly-optimized raw calls (for Win32, Win64, Mac64, Lin32)
  * ObjectiveC methods calls

= Planned features = 

  * pass and return structs by value
  * Mono/CLR interop
  * MS/.NET interop
