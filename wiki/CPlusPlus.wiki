#summary C++ support in BridJ

Please see [CurrentState].

BridJ only supports calling C++ code compiled with GCC4 and Visual C++ 9.0.

BridJ supports creating C++ class instances, calling C++ methods (including virtual and static).

It will soon support subclassing C++ classes from Java. 

See [TypeMapping] for more details.
